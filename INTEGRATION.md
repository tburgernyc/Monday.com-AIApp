## Architecture Overview

The Monday.com Claude Integration App consists of these main components:

1. **Frontend (React)**: Provides the user interface within Monday.com
2. **Backend (Node.js/Express)**: Processes requests and communicates with both APIs
3. **Claude API Client**: Handles natural language processing and AI responses
4. **Monday.com API Client**: Executes operations on the Monday.com platform

The application flow works as follows:

1. User enters a natural language request in the Monday.com interface
2. Request is sent to the backend server
3. Backend processes the request with Claude to generate structured actions
4. Backend executes the actions on Monday.com via GraphQL API
5. Results are processed with Claude again to generate user-friendly explanations
6. Response is sent back to the frontend for display

## Integration with External Systems

### Connecting to Other APIs

To integrate with additional external systems, extend the application by:

1. Create a new utility file in the project (e.g., `external-api-utils.js`)
2. Implement functions for communicating with the external API
3. Add environment variables for API keys and endpoints
4. Update the backend to use these new functions

Example for integrating with a CRM system:

```javascript
// external-api-utils.js
const axios = require('axios');
const { Logger, Environment } = require('@mondaycom/apps-sdk');

const logger = new Logger('crm-api-utils');
const env = new Environment();

// CRM API endpoint
const CRM_API_URL = env.get('CRM_API_URL');
const CRM_API_KEY = env.get('CRM_API_KEY');

/**
 * Fetch customer data from CRM
 * @param {string} customerId - Customer ID
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Customer data
 */
async function getCustomerData(customerId) {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `${CRM_API_URL}/customers/${customerId}`,
      {
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${CRM_API_KEY}`
        }
      }
    );
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to fetch customer data', { error });
    throw error;
  }
}

module.exports = {
  getCustomerData
};
