# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements made to the Monday.com Claude Integration App.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Removed Exposed API Keys**
   - Removed hardcoded API keys and secrets from the `.env` file
   - Created proper `.env.example` file with placeholders
   - Added `MONDAY_SIGNING_SECRET` to required environment variables

2. **Enhanced Encryption**
   - Updated encryption utility to require proper encryption keys
   - Added validation for encryption key format (64-character hex string)
   - Removed fallback to insecure hardcoded values
   - Added HMAC signature verification for data integrity

3. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Added validation for `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `SESSION_SECRET`
   - Enhanced validation for all environment variables
   - Added detailed error messages for missing or invalid variables
   - Application now fails to start if required security variables are missing

4. **Security Key Generation**
   - Added script to generate secure encryption keys and session secrets
   - Added npm script `generate-keys` to run the generator
   - Added npm script `setup` to install dependencies and generate keys
   - Updated documentation with instructions for key generation

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with security best practices
   - Added detailed security considerations section
   - Added instructions for generating and using security keys
   - Updated project structure documentation to include security-related files

## Detailed Changes

### 1. Environment Variables

The following environment variables are now required for secure operation:

```
ENCRYPTION_KEY=64-character-hex-string
SESSION_SECRET=at-least-32-characters-long
```

These can be generated using the provided script:

```bash
npm run generate-keys
```

### 2. Encryption Utility

The encryption utility (`utils/encryption.js`) has been updated to:

- Require a proper encryption key from environment variables
- Throw an error if the key is missing
- Use AES-256-GCM for all encryption operations
- Provide HMAC signature creation and verification
- Include secure token generation
- Mask sensitive data for logging

### 3. Environment Validation

The environment validator (`utils/env-validator.js`) has been updated to:

- Validate all required environment variables at startup
- Check format of security-related variables
- Provide detailed error messages for missing or invalid variables
- Fail fast if critical security variables are missing

### 4. Security Headers

The security middleware (`middleware/securityMiddleware.js`) provides:

- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Cross-Origin Resource Policy
- Strict Transport Security
- XSS protection
- Clickjacking prevention
- MIME type sniffing prevention

## Next Steps

While these improvements significantly enhance the security of the application, consider the following additional measures:

1. **Implement Redis for Session Storage**
   - Enable the Redis integration for distributed session storage
   - Configure proper Redis connection security

2. **Add Security Scanning**
   - Integrate security scanning tools in CI/CD pipeline
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies

3. **Implement Audit Logging**
   - Add detailed audit logs for security-sensitive operations
   - Store audit logs securely for compliance purposes

4. **Add Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Consider adding 2FA for administrative functions
   - Integrate with Monday.com's authentication where possible

5. **Regular Security Reviews**
   - Schedule regular security reviews of the codebase
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
